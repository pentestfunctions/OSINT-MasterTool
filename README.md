# OSINT-MasterTool
Random OSINT idea tool thing

I just really wanted to play around with PyQt5 and qtmodern to see what I could create. 

- Edit URLs to your liking - I made it reasonably modular even though it's all in one file. 
Build it out after for your windows machine using
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole OSINT.py
```

File will be built in the dist folder
